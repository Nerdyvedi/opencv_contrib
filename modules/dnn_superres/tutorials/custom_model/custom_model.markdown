Running inference on a custom model {#tutorial_dnn_superres_custom_model}
===========================

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the 'dnn_superres' interface to upscale via your own custom neural network.

Let's say you have created or found a neural network different from the networks included in this module, and you want to use this module
to help you with pre- and post-processing.
